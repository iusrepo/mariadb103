# Currently, there are mariadb and community-mysql packages in Fedora.
# This particular config file is included in respective RPMs of both of them,
# so the following settings are general and will be also used by both of them.
# Otherwise the RPMs would be in conflict.

# @INSTALL_SYSCONF2DIR@/server.cnf (part of mariadb-server).
# It doesn't matter that we set these settings only for [mysqld] here,
# because they will be read and used in mysqld_safe as well.
