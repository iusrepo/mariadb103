+For use in Red Hat distributions, you should run the script as user mysql,

+This will use the installed mysql executables, but will run a private copy
+of the server process (using data files within /usr/share/mysql-test),
+so you need not start the mysqld service beforehand.

+The "--skip-test-list=unstable-tests" option excludes tests that are
+known to fail on one or more Red-Hat-supported platforms.  You can omit it
+if you want to check whether such failures occur for you.  Documentation
+about the reasons for omitting such tests can be found in the file
+unstable-tests.

+To clean up afterwards, remove the created "var" subdirectory, eg
